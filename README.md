SDL Audio Example
=================

This is a simple SDL audio example for generated frequencies. Built while working on a gameboy emulator to experiment with the type of sound generation needed.

## Building

Requires SDL2 and SDL2_ttf. Has only been tested on mac os, but likely should build on linux/windows.

The binary `gbaudio_demo` is built in `build/output/bin`. Requires a font to run as the first argument. The excellent open VT323 font is included in the repo.
