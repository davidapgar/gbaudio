SDL Audio Example
=================

This is a simple SDL audio example for generated frequencies. Built while working on a gameboy emulator to experiment with the type of sound generation needed.

## Building

Requires SDL2 and SDL2_ttf. Has only been tested on mac os, but likely should build on linux/windows.
